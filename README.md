# RSA-Encryption

This repository contains a Python implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm. The implementation in this repository includes functions for setting up RSA keys, encrypting messages, and decrypting messages using RSA algorithm. The repository includes a test script that runs multiple trials to check the implementation's correctness. It generates random prime numbers for key generation, encrypts a random message, and then decrypts it to verify the accuracy.
